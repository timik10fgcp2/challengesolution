Implements the solution for a technical challenge that was given to me by the company on February, 10 2022. 

Due to privacy reasons (company's request not to post the solution on the internet), the detailed technical documentation was sent via email as opposed to writing a typical descritption here. Technical documentation is expected to be shown to a client as a walkthrough. That's why it is in the format of presentation with gradually increasing level of technical content.

Short description:  terraform code that creates a prototype of infrastructure containing 2 project, shared VPC, VMs, NAT and load balancer.
